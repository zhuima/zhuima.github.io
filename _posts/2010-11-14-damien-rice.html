实验室的机子要被占，要搬出来，所以得把资料整理一下。发现一个原来研一英语课上做representation的ppt,题目是介绍一位自己喜欢的歌手。那次第一次上台做英报告，呵呵。我喜欢缓慢而伤感，有些沉重的歌。在一位同学日记上看到介绍Damien Rice的，然后喜欢上了他的歌。研一那一年骑车时候基本都是这些歌，高中时最郁闷的时候经常听的是王菲和齐秦。一段时间狂听某些歌好像已经成了习惯，然后偶尔再听到的时候当时的情景自然就浮现了，音乐也是一种好的记忆载体。

<h2>Damien Rice</h2>


<p><img src="/images/18_over.jpg" alt="screen" class="img-center" width="256" height="295" /></p>

<a href="http://www.damienrice.com/">Damien Rice</a> is an Irish Rock singer.Two studio albums: O in 2003, and 9  in 2006.He was born and raised in Ireland,a country which is rich in country music, poets, singers. When He was young, music and drawing attract him. Rice was a member of the  rock band Juniper.Having released the singles "The World Is Dead" and "Weatherman" in Ireland during 1998.

Rice left the band to pursue a solo career. His Juniper band mates later became  Bell X1.

Rice's first solo album is O, which was released in 2003 and a true contender for one of the best albums of 2003, won the Shotlist Music Prize.Rice's style is simplity. The cover of this album is a beige hand painted portraits of the two small chiledren, which was drawed by himsefl. This is am simple folk album. This album contains a large number of hollow guitar chords , easy and simple percussion, drowning, backwards vocals, and low_key accompaniment .

Rice is master of what critic called "the unknown tongue" — basically the musical equivalent of the  "punctum" in photos, Rice's emtional singing brings me a sad ,clean and sophisticated intimate space. Three years later, following extensive promotion of O in Ireland and further success worldwide, Rice released his second studio album 9 in 2006.

9 crimes最好听，适合半夜失眠。MV拍得很吸引人，在<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgqOSCgc8xc">这里</a>，我当时课上放的就是这个MV，非常惊艳，课后还有同学问我要这个。另有个<a href="http://www.douban.com/review/1244828/">评论</a>感觉写得非常不错。
<a href="http://friends.chyangwa.com/qq/pics/blog/mp3/coldwater.mp3">Cold water</a>浮躁繁杂的时候，就来听听这样一首像诗歌般的曲子，这也是电影《偷心》的片尾插曲。木吉他很有感觉，以后有时间学学，呵呵。

还有这首<a href="http://www.mylalaland.com/hello/drice.mp3">The Blowers Daughter</a>非常不错。
